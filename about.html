				<div class="aboutmetxt">
					<p>After over a decade in the vinyl graphics industry wrapping vehicles, walls, buildings, and installing signage from window graphics to full trade show exhibits, God gave me an opportunity to launch my own brand doing the things I'm good at and enjoy.</p>
					<div class="backstory">
						<span>A little backstory...</span>
					</div>	
					
					<p>At the end of 2009, I graduated college with a degree in Graphic Design and immediately started my career in the industry working for a sign and graphics company in Charlotte, NC. One of my first projects was a custom graphics order on a Porsche Cayman S which was very exciting. I needed to produce these graphics from scratch and also match the color of the wheels when printing. At this time, I was still pretty new to a couple aspects of this project and I remember this being fun and challenging. After what felt like a thousand color swatches it all came together, the final product and the expression of the client was immensely satisfying and well worth the struggle to make it happen.</p>
					
						<br>
					<p>Since that project over a decade ago I have been designing, producing and installing graphics for the Charlotte and surrounding communities and even got an opportunity to travel the country for a year setting up trade show exhibits for brands like Husqvarna and Corning. There are ups and downs like anything else but having clients fall in love with their cars all over again and hearing how much new business my work has brought them, really make this a very satisfying and worthwhile pursuit.</p>

					<br>
					<p>In May of 2020, I was blessed in the middle of a pandemic with an opportunity to jump into business under my own brand. My main intent is to use the gifts I have to bless others through well designed, produced and expertly installed graphics. I believe these skills are a blessing when done well and at a fair price. For now, itâ€™s just me and God and I enjoy the level of quality Testament Graphic House can consistently produce because I personally install every square inch of vinyl under the Testament Graphic House name. Each and every square inch is a testament to the quality of our work, and the grace of a living God that gave me this opportunity.</p>
